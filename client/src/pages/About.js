        <p>
          I created this project which is inspired by my fascination with
          speculative biology. To see how hypothetical animals on other worlds
          evolved, you can see how it corresponds to our own. But every year, we
          lose more and more of the unique animals on our planet. Scientists at
          the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity concluded, “Every day, up
          to 150 species are lost.”. We can help these animals by giving even
          small donations; a castle is not built in a day, and neither is the
          work to help. If you find a charity not listed, you can help by adding
          it to this website, and hopefully, one day, we will not need it.
        </p>

        <p> Thank you.</p>
